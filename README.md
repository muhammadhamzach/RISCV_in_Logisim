# RISCV Implemented in Logisim
RISC-V is an open-source ISA and is partially implemented in Logisim software. Only part missing is the pipelining of the instructions.

### Note
The instructions that have been implemented are written in the InstructionsImplemented.txt file. Memory RISCV is suppoosed to be loaded in DMem for storage. ProgramRISCVLoadStoreOperateData,txt is loaded in the iMem.txt. The opcode in that file are written in English.txt file
